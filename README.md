# OAS.LPU TOOL

This is a chrome extension that helps you to view your result details, download answers, view personal info and view recently attempted tests.
extension is not affiliated with LPU. This is just a tool to help students view their results and other details.

Note: For some tests, the `download answers` option is not working. It will soon be fixed.
